Life Stats for skills, buffs, debuffs


Pixel Art RPG Format. 


This is just a fun, simple program that creates a user profile and tracks skill leveling and gaining experience in the skills listed.

Some Core Functions that should be implemented:

- Have a Profile Picture of the User
- Have their Name and Class?
- List of Skills, With Levels and Experience Bar (Maybe it should be quantified as hours twoards the skill?)
- Buffs and Debuffs (Good mood, Injuries, Phone addiction)
- Proficincies
- Acheivements


Off the dome thoughts: 

For tracking skill experience maybe there should be some time tracking built in. Maybe referring to an API of a different App like Forest or another habit tracking software?

Have a feature when the user first starts it asks how are they feeling today?
